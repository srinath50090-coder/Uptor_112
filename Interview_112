1.Machine learning:
      It is kind of algorithm that takes data, finds the pattern ,insightful,details
about the data and used for either "Prediction" or "Analysis"

2.How to achieve this?
      Process of doing thing on machine learning is done via libraries and many
software language.

Python,scikit-learn (best used combination)

3.What is data science?
      Process of finding insights,details, forecast, prediction about the data
(structured or unstructured ) via a algorithm and model is called data science.

Data science can be achieved using either "Machine learning" or "Deep learning"


4.what is the library which we can use for file reading?
 import csv
 import pandas

 Note:Pandas is widely used considering its easy reading option

 5.what are all the different file that can be reading using pandas

 csv,excel,JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)...

 6.Is it necessary to create virtual environment?
 Yes!!

 Virtual environment can be created using following two mechanism.

 1.through pycharm
 2.through command line prompt (h.w)

What is StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler

Both of this called Feature Scaling
Feature ---> input or x data or independent data
Scaling ---> Converting one form of numbers into another form of numbers

This Feature Scaling can be achieved by two libraries

1.from.sklearn preprocessing import StandardScaler
2.from.sklearn preprocessing import MinMaxScaler


StandardScaler ---> Returns the output in Normal distribution
MinMaxScaler ---> Returns the output in Uniform Distribution

StandardScaler value will be between -1 to 1
MinMaxScaler value will be between 0 to 1

When to use these feature scaling?

When we have different unit of measurement for different column , then model may not
perform well as expected.So we will be using to ensure all the columns stay in the
accepted distribution

Where it is used ?

Feature Scaling is used or can be used anywhere but specifically it should be used in
"Distance based algorithm"

When StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler :

StandardScaler :(KNN,SVM,KMeans,Hierarchical Clustering)
In all distance based algorithm

MinMaxScaler :
In all neural network based algorithms (Deep learning)

Note:Algorithms like Decision Tree,Random Forest,Linear Regression and
Logistic Regression may not scaling

What is Parametric and Non-Parametric Algorithms ?

Parametric : Column Based
        Linear Regression , Logistic Regression
        Technical answer : Finding the relationship just by the variance factor
        Laymen : Assumption

Non-Parametric : Column and Row
        Decision Tree , Random Forest
        Technical Answer : Finding the relationship but it goes deeper by the rows
        Laymen : Non-Assumption

What is Variance, Co-Variance, Co-relation ?

Variance - Within Column
Co-Variance - Between Column
Co-relation - Between Column but it may go some conversation before finding it

           -1 ---> negative co-relation
           +1 ---> positive co-relation
            0 ---> Poor

co-relation matrix defines same relationship number in matrix format and same can
be seen using the visualization chart :

          Answer: HEATMAP

What is bias-variance tradeoff?
