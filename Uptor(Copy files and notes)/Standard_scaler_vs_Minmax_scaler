### 1.When to go for standard scaler and when to go for min max scaler?

***When deciding between StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler, the choice
largely depends on the "Distribution" and "Range of your data",
as well as the "Type of model you're using"

-----------------------------StandardScaler:---------------------------------

------When to use it:------

***Gaussian Distribution:(Normal Distribution)
It works well when the data is approximately normally distributed
(bell-shaped curve). Since it centers the data around zero and scales it
based on standard deviation, it assumes the underlying data distribution
is Gaussian.

***Algorithms sensitive to variance:
This scaler is typically a better choice for algorithms that assume normally
distributed data or those that are sensitive to the scale, like:

--> Linear regression
--> Logistic regression
--> Support vector machines (SVM)
--> K-means clustering
--> Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

***Outliers:
StandardScaler is sensitive to outliers because they influence the mean and
standard deviation, so if your dataset has significant outliers, the scaler
will be affected.

Advantages:

It handles data that has large variations in scale well because it
standardizes everything to the same scale (mean = 0, variance = 1).

It works well with algorithms that assume Gaussian distribution, and is
especially beneficial for distance-based algorithms (like SVM, KNN).

Disadvantages:

Sensitive to outliers:
Outliers can heavily affect the mean and standard deviation, distorting
the scaling of the data.

Assumes normality, so it might not be ideal for data that is skewed or has a
non-Gaussian distribution.

------------------------------MinMaxScaler-----------------------------------

-----------When to use it:-------

***Non-Gaussian or skewed distributions:
If your data has a skewed distribution, the MinMaxScaler is often a better
choice because it works well even when data is not normally distributed.

***Algorithms sensitive to data scaling:
It is a good choice for algorithms where scaling to a specific range is
required, such as:

--> Neural networks (especially deep learning models)
--> Gradient-based algorithms
--> K-nearest neighbors (KNN), because it uses distance metrics, which are
    sensitive to the range.
--> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in some cases.

***Bounded range required:
If your machine learning model requires input features to be in a specific
range (e.g., neural networks usually work better when the input is between
0 and 1), then MinMaxScaler is ideal.

Advantages:

Preserves the relationships between data points:
If the range is important (e.g., preserving distances between points in a
dataset), MinMaxScaler helps retain that.

Does not assume a specific data distribution, so it works well for skewed
data or data with non-Gaussian distribution.

Good for neural networks:
Helps improve convergence speed when using neural networks.

Disadvantages:

Sensitive to outliers:
The presence of outliers can skew the MinMax scaling, as they will distort
the minimum and maximum values.

No robustness to outliers:
If your dataset contains outliers, they will dominate the scaling,
potentially leading to issues where the majority of your data is compressed
into a small range.

| **Method of Scaling**     | Z-score (mean = 0, std dev = 1)            | Scales between a fixed range (typically [0, 1])                |
| **Assumptions**           | Assumes data is approximately normal       | Does not assume any specific distribution                      |
| **Sensitive to Outliers** | Yes, outliers affect mean and std dev      | Yes, outliers affect the min and max values                    |
| **Use Case**              | Normal distribution, distance-based models | Non-normal distribution, neural networks, bounded range models |
| **Best for**              | Linear models, SVM, K-means, PCA           | Neural networks, KNN, non-Gaussian data                        |
| **Output Range**          | No fixed range (values can be negative)    | Fixed range (often [0, 1])                                     |
