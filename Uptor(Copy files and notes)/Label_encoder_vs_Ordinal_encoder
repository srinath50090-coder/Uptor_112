Both Label encoder and Ordinal encoder converts the categorical data into
numerical based on Alphabetical order but Label encoder handles the null data
but Ordinal encoder does not handle the null data

### 1.Then when we go for Label encoder and when we go for Ordinal encoder?

        Label encoder                             ordinal encoder
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
1.it designed only for "Target"          1.Used to encode "Feature columns"
  variables                                especially when "Meaningful order"

2.Converts category to numerical         2. Converts category to numerical
  based on "Alphabetical order"             based on "Alphabetical order" but
                                            We can and should "override" this if
                                            there is a true "ordinal relationship"
